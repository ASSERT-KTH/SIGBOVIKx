# SIGBOVIKx: The Local SIGBOVIK Conference Series

## ü§î What is SIGBOVIK?

[SIGBOVIK](https://sigbovik.org/) is the annual conference of the ACH (Association for Computational Heresy). It is what happens when brilliant CS academics drink too much coffee and decide that peer review should be fun. It's an annual conference celebrating the intersection of computer science and comedy, where researchers present papers that are:

- üß† Technically impressive
- üòÇ Hilariously absurd
- ü§Ø Mind-bendingly clever
- üí© Occasionally terrible

Think of it as academia's April Fool's Day, but with more LaTeX. Hosted at Carnegie Mellon University, SIGBOVIK (Special Interest Group on Harry Q. Bovik) honors the legendary researcher who definitely exists and isn't made up at all.

## üåç SIGBOVIKx: When You Can't Make It to Pittsburgh

Can't travel to CMU? Don't worry! SIGBOVIKx brings the joy of academic absurdity to your university. It's like TEDx but more serious. When your favorite band can't come to your city, you start a cover band, except our cover band has PhDs.

SIGBOVIKx is to SIGBOVIK what a tribute band is to The Beatles - flattering, enthusiastic, and legally distinct enough to avoid copyright issues. We hope.
